# api-service

This API contains a simple implementation of cloud storage.

### To get everything running, follow these steps:

1. By running docker-compose up we pull & build all required images and bring up all the
   containers for the application. API is exposed on port: 3000.

2. Storage can then be accessed by visiting http://www.localhost:3000.

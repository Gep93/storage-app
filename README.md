# api-service

This API contains a simple implementation of user and group management service.

### To get everything running, follow these steps:

1. By running docker-compose up we pull & build all required images and bring up all the
   containers for the application. API is exposed on port: 8000.

2. In order to use the application, you'll need to provide the state and structure to the database.
   To do this you need to run: go run . --migrate in the project directory, this will run all database migrations.
   To clear the database, you need to shred the state. In order to do that, you need to run: go run . --migrate-down.

### To get everything running localy, follow these steps:

Note: You will need latest release of Go installed on your machine in order to run API server locally.

1. By running docker-compose up -d we pull & build all required images and bring up all the
   containers for the application. API is exposed on port: 8080.

2. In order to use the application, you'll need to provide the state and structure to the database.
   To do this you need to run: go run . --migrate in the project directory, this will run all database migrations.
   To clear the database, you need to shred the state. In order to do that, you need to run: go run . --migrate-down.

3. By running go run . we run HTTP API Server.

### OpenAPI docs

API documentation is described in docs/openapi.yaml.  
This file is used when you run docker-compose up -d and go to http://localhost:5050/docs.

### Testing

If not already, you first need to execute docker-compose up -d and then go run . --migrate.

To run tests you need to be in tests directory.
You can run tests using go test -v.

Or simply run go test ./... in the project directory.

### Configuration

In config.json we define all necessary information, needed for connection to Postgres database.
